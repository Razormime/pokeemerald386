|| SPECIAL NOTES ||
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the original "Berry Update (v1.3)" I had made Engima Berries available, even though they are pretty
much a novelty - the berries don't really do anything special to Pokeblocks, and do nothing by themselves.
However, after a few days of thought, I've decided to remove them again (v1.3.3).
The problem with these berries is that a planted Enigma Berry will take a full 96hrs before it can be
harvested! If a player were to plant a bunch of these berries, not knowing they take so long to harvest
and that they have no real use, they will be stuck with these plants for a long time - ESPECIALLY if their
emulator does not have a working RTC (where they will need to pass 96hrs using actual play-time).

All OTHER berries are now infinitely obtainable without planting EXCEPT Lansat and Starf berries. 
I've left these two prizes as they are to keep their importance, however, I have updated the quantity you
recieve to THREE berries each (instead of just one) so that you can plant one and keep a couple in pocket
until the first plant has fully fruited, giving you more, and keeping berries safe from disappearing. My
advice is to put a couple on a few Pokemon you will never really use or release as backup.

SPECIAL THANKS: The "Berry FAQ (v0.991)" by verbalillusion on GameFAQs was consulted not only in preparing 
the info for vanilla acquisitions in this guide, but for also guiding me to which berries needed changing
or adding to the Emerald 386 project as a whole, so this is a super special thank you to them! Follow this
